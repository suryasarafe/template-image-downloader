# Image Downloader

This is nodejs application for downloading image, 

I just working with HTML Template that I think brought from the market from other, the file is inside is mostly placeholder image, well the requirement is to make the template up and running first with the image, i just don't want to do it manually because the Template is more than 15, this will help me today and maybe in the future so i just keep it for now
